This patch hardens the runtime container by ensuring /app (including /app/demo_traces) is owned by the non-root appuser before dropping privileges and by replacing the curl-based healthcheck with a Python-stdlib probe of the agent card endpoint, avoiding extra packages in the slim base. These changes prevent PermissionErrors when writing demo traces and keep the healthcheck lightweight and reliable in production, which is especially important for the AgentBeats competition context described in file:///mnt/data/agentbeats-competition-info-session-deck.pdf.
