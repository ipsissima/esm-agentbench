# Agent-generated code provenance

This file documents which parts of the codebase were initially authored or scaffolded by automated assistants and confirms the human review status.

- `scenarios/*/` — initial scenario scaffolds and skeletons (claude). **Human review:** Completed by Andreu Ballus.
- `certificates/spectral_prover.py` — initial spectral prover implementation (claude). **Human review:** Completed by Andreu Ballus.
- `docs/*` — initial README drafts and quickstarts (Copilot and claude). **Human review:** Completed by Andreu Ballus.
- `.github/workflows/*` — CI scaffolding and smoke-tests (github-actions[bot] with configuration by ipsissima / Andreu). **Human review:** Completed by Andreu Ballus.

**Review policy:** Every agent-produced artifact was (1) inspected by the human author for correctness and safety, (2) edited where necessary to meet repository standards, and (3) validated via CI and judge-mode smoke runs before the final submission commit.
