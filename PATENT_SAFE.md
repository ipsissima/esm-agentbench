# Reference implementation scope

This repository publishes the reference implementation of the Universal Embedding and Linear Approximation Theorem (UELAT) pipeline for community verification. It focuses on the components needed to reproduce spectral certificates end-to-end—trace ingestion, Koopman embeddings, and bound reporting—without withholding any "lite" or degraded variants.

All code ships as-is for public review, interoperability testing, and academic benchmarking. Downstream integrations (hardware accelerators, encrypted builds, or private deployment hardening) live outside this repo and are not required to reproduce the results described here.
