Start the Flask assessor manually by running `python assessor/app.py` from the repo root, then open a second terminal and launch `ngrok http 8080` (or your chosen NGROK_PORT) after ngrok is authenticated. When the ngrok dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:4040 shows an HTTPS forwarding address, copy that host (for example `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io`) and update `agent_card.toml` so the entry reads `entrypoint = "https://abcd1234.ngrok.io/.well-known/agent-card.json"` without an extra slash before `.well-known`. Save the file, then run `git add agent_card.toml && git commit -m "CI: set agent_card entrypoint to ngrok URL"` to record the change.

After committing, use that HTTPS entrypoint in the competition UI so the controller can fetch `.well-known/agent-card.json` from your live tunnel; ensure your repository is published or otherwise visible to the controller when using that URL. Never store secrets like OPENAI_API_KEY in agent_card.toml or the repo—keep them in the platform’s secret store instead.
